This bot is for Lithuanian Airsoft Community to check upcoming events

Here im using Replit local secrets which im passing my id's and Token in other env they should be storred in .env for that dotenv should be installed:
TOKEN - token of your bot
CLIENT_ID - BOT ID
GUILD_ID - Discord Server ID
CHANNEL_ID - Discord Channel ID

packages that should be installed:
*node.js
*discord.js
*dotenv
*node-fetch
*node-schedule

What i consider would be great to do:
*Refactor code, so it would be more readable 
*Add Embed that will have link to add event to Google Calendar, link should be wraped with text "Click to ADD to Google Calendar" something like that
*Test Scheduled Job, didnt have opportunity to do that.
